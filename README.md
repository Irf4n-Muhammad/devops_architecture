## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using a combination of powerful tools: GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes. The pipeline is designed to automate code integration, containerization, configuration management, and deployment to Kubernetes, enabling efficient and reliable application delivery.

## Architecture
The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following components:

1. GitHub: Used as the version control system for storing and managing the codebase.
2. Jenkins: Acts as the CI/CD server to build, test, and integrate the code changes.
3. Docker: Used to containerize the application for consistent environments across development and production.
4. Ansible: Handles configuration management and deployment automation.
5. Kubernetes: Serves as the container orchestration platform for managing and scaling the deployed application.

# Setting Up the Pipeline
## Step 1: Configure GitHub
- Push your application code to a GitHub repository.
- Set up a webhook in GitHub to trigger Jenkins builds.
## Step 2: Set Up Jenkins
Install the following Jenkins plugins:
- Git Plugin
- Docker Plugin
- Pipeline Plugin
Create a Jenkins job:
- Pull code from the GitHub repository.
= Build the application and create a Docker image.
- Push the Docker image to a registry.
## Step 3: Integrate Ansible
Write Ansible playbooks to:
- Pull Docker images.
- Deploy the application to Kubernetes or as standalone Docker containers.
## Step 4: Deploy to Kubernetes
Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is running and kubeconfig is properly set up.
Use Ansible to apply Kubernetes manifests and manage deployments.
