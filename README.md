## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using a combination of powerful tools: GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes. The pipeline is designed to automate code integration, containerization, configuration management, and deployment to Kubernetes, enabling efficient and reliable application delivery.

## Architecture
The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following components:

1. GitHub: Used as the version control system for storing and managing the codebase.
2. Jenkins: Acts as the CI/CD server to build, test, and integrate the code changes.
3. Docker: Used to containerize the application for consistent environments across development and production.
4. Ansible: Handles configuration management and deployment automation.
5. Kubernetes: Serves as the container orchestration platform for managing and scaling the deployed application.
